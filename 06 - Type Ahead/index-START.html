        html, video, image, audio, document etc. we know that it IS json
        so the raw data needs to be converted TO json. if you look in the
        log under Response prototype you will see a json: json() method

        items into the cities array
        .then(data => cities.push(data));
        if you do this then you are nesting your data and you'll be placing an array
        inside the cities array. (probably not what we want)
        notice that every time you push something to the cities array it adds a new
        item in the cities array. so the way that we can change this array into 
        individual arguments is we _spread into it_ via the es6 spread operator!
